<p>With ML Kit's digital ink recognition API, you can recognize handwritten text and classify gestures on a digital surface in hundreds of languages, as well as classify sketches. The digital ink recognition API uses the same technology that powers handwriting recognition in Gboard, Google Translate, and the Quick, Draw! game.</p>
<p>Write on the screen instead of typing on a virtual keyboard. This lets users draw characters that are not available on their keyboard, such as ệ, अ or 森 for latin alphabet keyboards.</p>
<p>Perform basic text operations (navigation, editing, selection, and so on) using gestures.</p>
<p>Recognize hand‑drawn shapes and emojis.</p>
